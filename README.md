# Phase Transitions in Mean-Variance Regression

This repository contains code and materials for our research on pathologies, stability, and phase transitions in deep mean–variance (heteroskedastic) regression.  
It supports both the UAI 2024 paper and the extended arXiv preprint (under review), which have different titles.
